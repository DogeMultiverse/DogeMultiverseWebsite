Doge Multiverse tokens are a BEP20 token used to transact in game skins/cosmetics. This allows for transparency for the players as well as a universal utility currency that can be used across all games (not just crypto games). Players are allowed to farm and trade those tokens and they can buy more via swapping with BNB. Currently with our MVP, we have over 20,000+ unique players and 100+ daily players in our servers, all organic players without any marketing spent.

95% is locked in the contract and buyable via the contract. the rest is distributed to multiple funds for different purposes, eg, marketing, community, administrative. No token distribution schedule.
